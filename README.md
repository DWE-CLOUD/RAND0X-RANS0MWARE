# Rand0xer : Ransomware Made using python

# *Overview*

This project is a demonstration of encryption and cybersecurity concepts using Python programming language. The project showcases the implementation of file encryption, offline encryption capabilities, and data stealing simulation. Various libraries and modules, including pyaescrypt, win32api, subprocess, tkinter, socket, bs4, base64, sqlite3, win32crypt, shutil, and PIL, have been utilized to create this demonstration.
Features

    File Encryption: The project demonstrates the process of encrypting files using the pyaescrypt library. It showcases how encryption can be used to secure sensitive data.

    Offline Mode: The project includes functionality for offline encryption, which ensures that the encryption process can be carried out even without an active internet connection.

    Data Stealing Simulation: The project simulates data stealing for educational purposes. It highlights how attackers might attempt to steal sensitive information from a system.

    Graphical User Interface: The project uses the tkinter library to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the demonstration.
